`url` paramater is the url of the api being called

`opts` is optional as shown by the ? following it. It can be any type and is the request

`opts.headers` is a object that consists of the header elements in an api request

`opts.method` is the type of api call (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, or PATCH)

`opts.body` is the request body

_further exploration of the `return` may be needed to understand this_
