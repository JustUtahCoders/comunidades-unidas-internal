I know that the

```javascript
useAlwaysValidPage(apiState, dispatchApiState);
useClientsApi(apiState, dispatchApiState);
useFrontendUrlParams(apiState, dispatchApiState);
```

are getting their params from `userFullWidth()`, but I'm not following what `useReducer()` does outside of that it works like Redux was meant to, but I think my confusion is from not actually really understanding what Redux does step by step.
