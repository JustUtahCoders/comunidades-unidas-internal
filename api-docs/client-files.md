# Client files

This api is provided to upload and keep track of client files.
To upload or access any file you need the corresponding signed url.

### API flow

If performing an upload you will get a signed url via `/api/signed-file-uploads` you will then make
a PUT request to the url like so

```javascript
axios.put(signedRequest, file, options).then((result) => {
  if (result.data.success) {
    //Make the request to create a client file /api/clients/:clientId/file
  }
});
```

After you upload the file to S3, you need to tell the web server that you
did so by calling `http POST /api/clients/:clientId/files`

For each file that you want to download you would make a request to `/api/clients/:clientId/files/:fileId/signed-downloads` then
you would make a request on the front end like so `window.location.href = downloadurl`

## Get a signed POST URL

```http
GET /api/clients/:clientId/signed-file-uploads
```
